# PhD---Data-analysis
This repository contains descriptions of MATLAB scripts developed for data analysis as part of my PhD.  
The full content of my PhD can be found in the [University of Auckland Doctoral Thesis
Repository](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/items/0f9a32c3-04a2-40f5-b45f-1fe59bb2bfbd). 
All scripts used in my PhD thesis is found in the [Cheyne Lab Github repository](https://github.com/juliettecheyne/cheyne_lab/tree/main/Pang%20Ying%20Cheung%20Thesis).

### Brief description of my PhD research:
I investigated brain activity in the region of the brain responsible for processing sound (the auditory cortex) from a model with a specific gene removed. 
The gene in question plays a role in maintaining stable connections between brain cells, which is important for normal brain functions. 
The purpose of this scientific research was to gain insight into the role of the gene in brain functions relating to sound processing. To answer this scientific question, I 
extracted data from video files and conducted four main analyses. 

### Scripts in this repository
1. [Reducing signal contamination in video files.](https://github.com/PYingC/PhD---Data-analysis/blob/main/Pt1.%20Reducing%20signal%20contamination%20in%20video%20files.pdf) 
   <br />**Description:** Used principle components analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to reduce signal contamination in video files.

2. [Image processing and data analysis.](https://github.com/PYingC/PhD---Data-analysis/blob/main/Pt2.%20Image%20processing%20and%20data%20extraction%20from%20images.pdf))
   <br />**Description:** To extract relevant data from video files for analysis.

3. [Investigating brain activity in a model with a specific gene removed.](https://github.com/PYingC/PhD---Data-analysis/blob/main/Pt3.%20Statistical%20Analysis.pdf)
   <br />**Description:** Performed statistical analysis on data to determine if differences were observed in the model with the specific gene removed.

4. Correlation analysis between different regions of the brain.
    <br />**Description:** Determined functional connectivity between regions of the brain using Pearson's correlation analysis and
    linear regression.
